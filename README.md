üìù Description

This project implements a Smart Irrigation and Remote Monitoring System using the MQTT communication protocol. It automates crop irrigation based on real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data. The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers, sensors, and relays to control a water pump and communicate with a cloud-based MQTT broker for remote monitoring and control.

Key Features:

Real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring

Automated and manual irrigation control

MQTT-based communication for low-latency data transmission

Cloud dashboard for remote data visualisation

Energy-efficient operation suitable for off-grid farms

Tech Stack:

Hardware: ESP32, DHT22, Soil Moisture Sensor, Relay Module, Pump

Software: Arduino IDE, MQTT (Mosquitto / HiveMQ / Adafruit IO), Node-RED Dashboard

Use Case:
Designed for smart farming and precision agriculture applications to optimise water usage and improve crop yield through intelligent automation.
